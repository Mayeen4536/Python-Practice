# Python-Practice

* Jadoo, the space alien has challenged Koba to a friendly duel. He asks Koba to write a program to print out all numbers from 70 to 80.   Knowing perfectly well how easy the problem is, the Jadoo adds his own twist to the challenge. He asks Koba to write the program without using a single number in his program and also restricts the character limit to 100.

* Jadoo hates numbers, but he requires to print a special number "420" to recharge the equation of life. He asks your help to print the number but Since he hates numbers, he asks you to write the program such that there would not be any number in the code.

* Jadoo, the Space Alien has befriended Koba upon landing on Earth. Since then, he wishes Koba to be more like him. In order to do so he decides to slowly transcribe Koba's DNA into RNA. But he has to write a very short code in order to do the transcription so as not to make Koba aware of the change.
The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
          * G --> C
          * C --> G
          * T --> A
          * A --> U
 
 * You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.
 * You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to N.
 * Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores.     Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
     # Input:
The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.
